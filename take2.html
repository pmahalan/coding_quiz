- the conclusion message

  //have your landing page first.
  //And a start button.
  //Then, a function that triggers the questions.
  //Then a timer function.
  //function to validate right or wrong; reduce time or not reduce time. (if-else statement)
  //Another if-else: if no more questions go to result screen, if there are questions then go to the next one.

// The array of questions for our quiz game.



//Is there somethign to the syntax of this function, or is it not useful here...?
function click(event) {
    
}

// The begining of the for-loop to enable us to cycle through the questions!!!
// Starting with the 0-th index, it populates through each index of the "questions" array.

for(var i = 0; i < questions.length; i++) { }

//How do I add an event listener so that the next question pops up and the previous one disappears, once someone selects an answer??

addEventListener("click", questions.length, i++)
